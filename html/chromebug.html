  <h1>Test Case For Weird Chrome Behavior</h1>
  <p>This page runs a SHA-512 (Jeff Mott's CryptoJS implementation v3.0.2) on the input string that
  	contains 12 \x36 characters.  It does so 100 times and complains if the results don't 
  	align.  If it finds a disagreement, it will output the attempts that didn't match
  	(when compared to the 0th attempt which always comes out correctly).
  </p>
  <p>This page gives me unstable results on Chrome 25.0.1364.99 on Mac OS X 10.8.2.  Reload a few times
  	to see what I mean.</p>
  <p>It works as expected on recent versions of Sarafi and Firefox (and older versions of Chrome).</p>
